# A beginner's Rails templates

I use these templates to setup Rails projects. The basic setup uses the following.

For views I'm using

* JQuery which is now the default
* Sass, actually Scss
* Simple_Form for which I've included some Scss

For testing I've become accustom to

* RSpec
* Capybara
* Factory_Girl
* Mocha, when necessary

Oh, and I'm using Ruby 1.9.3 now too.

## Rails Apps Composer

There's also a new template generated with rails apps composer (git://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer.git). I've not used it much yet, but it looks good.

Fork these if you like, and do what you will, but I'm offering no warrantees. Remember these are the work of a relative novice.
