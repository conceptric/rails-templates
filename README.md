# A beginner's Rails templates

I use these templates to setup Rails projects. The basic setup uses the following.

For views I'm using

* JQuery
* Haml
* Sass, actually Scss
* Simple_Form for which I've included some Scss

For testing I've become accustom to

* Factory_Girl
* RSpec
* Webrat, but that might change to Capybara

Fork these if you like, and do what you will, but I'm offering no warrantees. Remember these are the work of a relative novice.
